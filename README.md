🐢 Turtle Control Panel – My first Python project! Control a turtle with buttons: y (left), x (right), start (forward), circle, home, clear. Now YOU can improve it! Add colors, speed control, pen up/down, new shapes, or anything you imagine. Be creative, don't break the original, and have fun! Fork, change, and share. Made by pintoto (13, Iran). ❤️
